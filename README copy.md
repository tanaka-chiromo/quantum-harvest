## Game Rules

### Victory Conditions

Players can win by achieving any of the following:

1. **Unit Elimination**: Eliminate all of the opponent's units
2. **Energy Victory**: Accumulate more energy than your opponent by episode end
3. **Territory Victory**: Control more territory than your opponent by episode end
4. **Turn Limit**: Episodes end after 1000 turns (default, configurable)

### Map Generation

- **Size**: Default 12×12 grid (configurable)
- **Energy Nodes**: Randomly placed pairs containing 1000-2000 energy each
- **Quantum Structures**: Barriers, entanglement zones, decoherence fields, and quantum gates
- **Symmetric Layout**: Both players start with equal resources and positioning

### Turn Flow

1. Both players receive game state observation
2. Players select actions for all their units simultaneously
3. Actions are executed in resolution order (see below)
4. Game state updates and victory conditions are checked
5. Next turn begins

### Action Resolution Order

**Player 1 (player_id=0) has first-move advantage:**
- All of Player 1's unit actions are processed **first**
- All of Player 2's unit actions are processed **second**

**Strategic implications:**
- **Contested tiles**: If both players move to the same empty tile, Player 1's unit gets it
- **Resource competition**: Player 1 can claim energy nodes first
- **Attack priority**: Player 1's attacks resolve before Player 2's
- **Position blocking**: Player 1 can occupy strategic positions before Player 2 can reach them

**Example - Contested Tile:**
```
Setup: Both players move units to the same empty tile (3, 3)
Resolution:
  1. Player 1's unit moves to (3, 3) ✅ (processed first)
  2. Player 2's unit tries to move to (3, 3) ❌ (blocked by Player 1's unit)
Result: Player 1's unit occupies (3, 3), Player 2's unit stays at original position
```

**Strategic considerations:**
- Player 1 should be aggressive in contested situations (has advantage)
- Player 2 should anticipate Player 1's moves and plan alternative strategies
- Quantum gates allow shared occupancy, negating this advantage for those tiles

### Fog of War and Exploration

**Exploration System:**

Each unit explores tiles around it based on its **exploration range** (Manhattan distance):
- **Scouts**: 3 tiles (best vision)
- **Harvesters**: 1 tile
- **Warriors**: 1 tile

**Permanent Exploration:**
- Once a tile is explored, it remains **permanently visible** to that player
- Explored tiles never become "fog of war" again
- You have **continuous real-time vision** of all explored tiles

**What You Can See in Explored Tiles:**

✅ **Always Visible:**
- **Tile types**: Energy nodes, barriers, gates, zones, decoherence fields
- **Resources**: Current energy levels in energy nodes
- **Structures**: All quantum structures and their states
- **Enemy units**: Enemy units are visible **whenever** they are in explored tiles
- **Unit details**: Full information about visible enemy units (type, health, position, boost status)

❌ **Never Visible:**
- **Unexplored tiles**: Show as unknown (`-1` in fog_maps)
- **Enemy units in unexplored areas**: Completely hidden until you explore those tiles

**Strategic implications:**
- **Scouts are crucial** for map vision (3-tile range vs 1-tile for others)
- **Early exploration** gives permanent vision advantage
- **Enemy movements are tracked** in real-time within explored areas
- **Enemies can hide** by retreating to unexplored territory
- **Resource monitoring** - you can track enemy harvesting activity in explored areas
- **No re-exploration needed** - once explored, always visible

### Unit Types

#### Harvester (Unit Type 0)
**Role**: Resource collection specialist

- **Cost**: 10 energy
- **Health**: 45 HP
- **Harvest Rate**: 1.0 energy/turn (most efficient)
- **Attack Damage**: Cannot attack
- **Movement**: 1 tile per turn
- **Exploration Range**: 1 tile
- **Building Abilities**: Decoherence fields, quantum barriers, quantum gates

**Strategy**: Essential for early game energy accumulation. Vulnerable to warriors—protect accordingly.

#### Warrior (Unit Type 1)
**Role**: Combat and territory control specialist

- **Cost**: 100 energy
- **Health**: 45 HP
- **Harvest Rate**: Cannot harvest
- **Attack Damage**: 30 HP/attack (normal), 45 HP/attack (boosted)
- **Attack Range**: 1 tile (normal), 4 tiles (boosted)
- **Movement**: 1 tile per turn
- **Exploration Range**: 1 tile
- **Special Abilities**: 
  - Can receive entanglement boosts (1.5× damage multiplier, 4-tile range)
  - Can create entanglement zones
  - Can build all quantum structures
  - Boost duration: 2 attacks, then returns to normal

**Strategy**: Primary combat unit. Use entanglement zones to boost attack power and range. Expensive but powerful.

#### Scout (Unit Type 2)
**Role**: Exploration, spawning, and quantum operations specialist

- **Cost**: 10 energy
- **Health**: 45 HP
- **Harvest Rate**: 0.25 energy/turn (moderate)
- **Attack Damage**: Cannot attack
- **Movement**: 1 tile per turn
- **Exploration Range**: 3 tiles (best vision)
- **Special Abilities**:
  - Can spawn new units (harvesters, warriors, scouts)
  - Can create entanglement zones
  - Can build all quantum structures
  - Access to quantum movement and measurement
  - Can use quantum gates

**Strategy**: Versatile support unit. Superior vision range makes it excellent for reconnaissance. Can spawn units and build structures.

### Tile Types and Quantum Mechanics

#### Energy Nodes (TileType.ENERGY_NODE = 1)
**Purpose**: Harvestable resource nodes

- **Energy content**: 1000-2000 units per node
- **Harvest formula**: `harvest_amount = base_amount × unit_efficiency`
- **Fixed harvest amounts**:
  - Harvester: 1.0 energy per harvest (0.5 base × 2.0 efficiency)
  - Scout: 0.25 energy per harvest (0.25 base × 1.0 efficiency)
  - Warrior: Cannot harvest (0.0 efficiency)
- **Depletion**: Each harvest reduces node energy by 1.0; nodes become empty when depleted
- **Usage**: Units must use HARVEST action while standing on the node

**Strategy**: Core resource for economy. Protect with warriors and harvest efficiently with harvesters.

#### Quantum Barriers (TileType.QUANTUM_BARRIER = 2)
**Purpose**: Movement blocking and area denial

- **Construction cost**: 200 energy
- **Built by**: Any unit on adjacent empty tiles
- **Movement blocking**: Regular MOVE action fails on barriers
- **Quantum movement**: QUANTUM_MOVE always costs 100 energy but can pass through barriers
- **Line-of-sight blocking**: Blocks warrior attack line-of-sight

**Strategy**: Force enemies to use expensive quantum movement (100 energy) instead of free regular movement. Use defensively to protect key areas or offensively to limit enemy mobility.

#### Entanglement Zones (TileType.ENTANGLEMENT_ZONE = 3)
**Purpose**: Combat enhancement for warriors

- **Construction cost**: 100 energy
- **Built by**: Warriors and scouts only
- **Zone power**: 200 units (depletes with use)
- **Automatic boost**: Warriors automatically receive boosts when stepping onto entanglement zones (if not already boosted and zone has power)
- **Boost effects**: 
  - 1.5× damage multiplier
  - 4-tile attack range (vs normal 1-tile)
  - Lasts for exactly 2 attacks
  - Consumes 50 power from zone per boost
- **Occupancy**: Multiple units from same team can occupy; opposing teams cannot share
- **Depletion**: Zone becomes empty when power reaches zero

⚠️ **Critical**: Can boost enemy warriors too! Use carefully.

**Strategy**: Build near frontlines to enhance warrior attacks. Be cautious—enemies can use your zones against you.

#### Decoherence Fields (TileType.DECOHERENCE_FIELD = 4)
**Purpose**: Defensive protection and boost removal

- **Construction cost**: 100 energy
- **Built by**: Any unit
- **Defensive effect**: 50% damage reduction for units on these tiles
- **Anti-boost effect**: Removes all boosts from warriors who land on these tiles (both regular and quantum movement trigger this)

**Strategy**: Use defensively to reduce incoming damage. Place strategically to neutralize enemy boosted warriors.

#### Quantum Gates (TileType.QUANTUM_GATE = 5)
**Purpose**: Health restoration and teleportation

- **Construction cost**: 100 energy
- **Built by**: Any unit
- **Health restoration**: QUANTUM_GATE_HEALTH_GAIN action restores 50 health for 50 energy (max 300 health)
- **Teleportation**: QUANTUM_GATE_TELEPORT action allows instant movement to any other quantum gate for 25 energy
  - Must be standing on a quantum gate to teleport
  - Target must also be a quantum gate
  - Failed teleports cost 0 energy
- **Shared occupation**: Both teams can occupy the same quantum gate simultaneously

**Strategy**: Create gate networks for rapid repositioning and healing. Useful for quick reinforcement or retreat.

### Combat Mechanics

#### Attack Range and Line-of-Sight

When a warrior attacks (Action Type 7), the game searches for targets along the specified direction:

**Rules:**
1. **First-target priority**: Attack hits the **first enemy unit** encountered along the attack direction
2. **Range limits**: 
   - Normal warriors: 1 tile range (adjacent only)
   - Entanglement-boosted warriors: 4 tiles range
3. **Line-of-sight blocking**: 
   - ✅ **Can attack through**: Empty tiles, energy nodes, entanglement zones, decoherence fields, quantum gates
   - ❌ **Cannot attack through**: Quantum barriers (block line of sight)
4. **Map boundaries**: Attack search stops at map edges

**Examples:**

```
Example 1 - Clear line of sight:
W . . E .    (W = Your boosted warrior, E = Enemy, . = Empty)
Action: [7, 2, 1, 0] (attack right)
Result: ✅ Hits enemy at distance 3

Example 2 - Multiple enemies in line:
W . E E .
Action: [7, 2, 1, 0] (attack right)
Result: ✅ Hits the FIRST enemy at distance 2 (not the farther one)

Example 3 - Barrier blocking:
W . B E .    (B = Quantum barrier)
Action: [7, 2, 1, 0] (attack right)
Result: ❌ Cannot attack - barrier blocks line of sight

Example 4 - Out of range (normal warrior):
W . . E .
Action: [7, 2, 1, 0] (attack right, not boosted)
Result: ❌ Cannot attack - enemy at distance 3, normal warriors only have 1-tile range
```

#### Damage Calculation

**Damage Formula**: 
```
damage = 15 × 2.0 × (1 + energy_boost × 0.2) × entanglement_multiplier
```

Where:
- `entanglement_multiplier = 1.5` (if warrior is boosted) or `1.0` (normal)
- `energy_boost` ranges from 0 to 4

**Damage and Energy Cost Table:**

| energy_boost | Normal Damage | Boosted Damage | Energy Cost |
|--------------|---------------|----------------|-------------|
| 0 (base)     | 30 HP         | 45 HP          | 15 energy   |
| 1            | 36 HP         | 54 HP          | 16 energy   |
| 2            | 42 HP         | 63 HP          | 17 energy   |
| 3            | 48 HP         | 72 HP          | 18 energy   |
| 4            | 54 HP         | 81 HP          | 19 energy   |

**Strategic implications:**
- Use quantum barriers defensively to block enemy warrior line-of-sight
- Boosted warriors can attack from safer distances (up to 4 tiles)
- Position units carefully—warriors always hit the closest enemy in their line of fire
- Energy boost provides marginal damage increases at increasing cost

#### Unit Stacking and Target Selection

**Where Units Can Stack:**

1. **Quantum Gates**: ✅ Both teams can occupy the same quantum gate simultaneously
   - Multiple friendly units can stack
   - Multiple enemy units can stack on the same gate
   - This is the ONLY tile type that allows enemy stacking

2. **All Other Tiles**: ❌ Enemy units cannot occupy the same tile
   - Multiple units from the same team CAN stack
   - Units from opposing teams CANNOT stack (movement blocked)

**Attack Target Selection on Stacked Units:**

When a warrior attacks a tile with multiple enemy units, the game automatically selects ONE target based on a priority system.

**Priority Formula**: `Score = (100 - unit_health) + (unit_type_priority × 50)`

**Unit Type Priorities:**
- **Harvester**: Priority 3 (150 points) - Highest priority
- **Scout**: Priority 2 (100 points) - Medium priority  
- **Warrior**: Priority 1 (50 points) - Lowest priority

**Selection rules:**
1. Lower health increases priority (wounded units more likely targeted)
2. Unit type matters more than health in most cases
3. Only ONE unit takes damage per attack (highest scoring target)

**Examples:**

```
Example 1 - Type priority dominates:
Quantum Gate has:
- Enemy Harvester (45 HP): Score = (100-45) + (3×50) = 205
- Enemy Warrior (30 HP): Score = (100-30) + (1×50) = 120
Target: Harvester (despite having more health)

Example 2 - Long-range attack on stacked enemies:
Your boosted warrior is 3 tiles away from stacked enemies:
- Enemy Scout (45 HP): Score = 155
- Enemy Harvester (30 HP): Score = 220
- Enemy Warrior (45 HP): Score = 105
Target: Harvester at 30 HP (highest score)
Result: Only the Harvester takes damage
```

**Strategic implications:**
- Don't stack harvesters with other units—they're almost always targeted first
- Stacking is risky even from long range
- Warriors are the best "shields" (lowest target priority)
- Low-health units become more attractive targets
- Quantum gates are especially risky for valuable units
- Spread out valuable units when possible

## State Space Reference

### Observation Structure

The game provides a comprehensive observation dictionary:

```python
observation = {
    'map': np.ndarray,                    # 2D array (map_size × map_size) of tile types
    'units': np.ndarray,                  # Array of all units [unit_id, player_id, unit_type, x, y, health, energy, is_boosted, boost_attacks]
    'player_energy': np.ndarray,          # Array [player_0_energy, player_1_energy]
    'turn': np.ndarray,                   # Current turn number [turn]
    'fog_maps': np.ndarray,               # Player-specific fog of war maps

    'exploration_percentage': np.ndarray, # Exploration percentage per player
    'victory_conditions': dict            # Victory condition status
}
```

### Map Array (`observation['map']`)

2D numpy array where each tile is represented by an integer from the `TileType` enum:

- **-1 (UNEXPLORED)**: Tile not yet explored (appears in `fog_maps` only)
- **0 (EMPTY)**: Regular empty tile that can be built upon
- **1 (ENERGY_NODE)**: Contains harvestable energy
- **2 (QUANTUM_BARRIER)**: Blocks regular movement
- **3 (ENTANGLEMENT_ZONE)**: Provides quantum boosts to warriors
- **4 (DECOHERENCE_FIELD)**: Provides defensive protection
- **5 (QUANTUM_GATE)**: Allows health restoration and teleportation

### Units Array (`observation['units']`)

Each unit is represented as an array with 9 elements:

```python
[unit_id, player_id, unit_type, x, y, health, energy, is_boosted, boost_attacks_remaining]
```

- **unit_id**: Unique identifier for the unit (int)
- **player_id**: 0 for Player 1, 1 for Player 2
- **unit_type**: 0=Harvester, 1=Warrior, 2=Scout
- **x, y**: Position coordinates on the map
- **health**: Current health points (default: 45, max: 300)
- **energy**: Current energy points (default: 0, not used in gameplay)
- **is_boosted**: Boolean (0 or 1) indicating if unit has entanglement boost
- **boost_attacks_remaining**: Number of boosted attacks remaining (0-2)

**Note**: Only units in explored tiles are visible to each player (own units always visible).

### Other Observation Fields

- **player_energy**: `[player_0_energy, player_1_energy]` - visible to both players
- **turn**: `[current_turn_number]` - shared information
- **fog_maps**: Player-specific explored/unexplored tile maps (unexplored = -1)
- **territory_control**: `[player_0_control%, player_1_control%]` - visible to both players
- **exploration_percentage**: `[player_0_explored%, player_1_explored%]` - player-specific

---

## Action Space Reference

### Action Format

Each action is a 4-element array:

```python
[action_type, direction_x, direction_y, energy_boost]
```

- **action_type**: Integer 0-16 (see below)
- **direction_x**: 0=left, 1=no_move, 2=right (for most actions)
- **direction_y**: 0=up, 1=no_move, 2=down (for most actions)
- **energy_boost**: 0-4 energy points for attack damage boost (only used by Action 7)

**Special case**: For QUANTUM_GATE_TELEPORT (Action 13), `direction_x` and `direction_y` represent absolute target coordinates instead.

### Movement Actions

## Agent Development Guide

### Getting Started

**Reference Implementation**: See `quantum_harvest/starter_agent.py` for a complete working example.

The starter agent demonstrates:
- How to parse the observation dictionary
- How to structure actions for each unit
- How to access game state information
- Common helper methods for agent development

### Agent Interface

Your agent class must inherit from `BaseAgent` and implement the required methods:

```python
from quantum_harvest.agents import BaseAgent
from quantum_harvest.utils import UnitType, ActionType, TileType
from typing import Dict
import numpy as np

class Agent(BaseAgent):
    """Your custom agent implementation."""
    
    def __init__(self, player_id: int):
        """
        Initialize the agent.
        
        Args:
            player_id: ID of the player this agent controls (0 or 1)
        """
        super().__init__(player_id)
    
    def get_action(self, observation: Dict[str, np.ndarray], player_id: int = 0) -> Dict[int, np.ndarray]:
        """
        Get actions for all units.
        
        Args:
            observation: Current game observation (see State Space Reference)
            player_id: Player ID (0 or 1) - defaults to 0
            
        Returns:
            actions: Dictionary mapping unit_id to action array 
                    [action_type, direction_x, direction_y, energy_boost]
        """
        actions = {}
        # Your agent logic here
        return actions
    
    def reset(self):
        """Reset agent state between games."""
        super().reset()
```

### Development Tips

1. **Parse Units Correctly**: Use the observation structure to identify your units and their states
   ```python
   player_units = observation['units'][observation['units'][:, 1] == self.player_id]
   ```

2. **Handle Action Validation**: The environment validates actions, but invalid actions are ignored
   - Check energy before expensive actions
   - Verify tile types before building
   - Confirm unit types match action requirements

3. **Energy Management**: Balance energy spending between:
   - Unit production (harvesters = 10, warriors = 100, scouts = 10)
   - Structure building (barriers = 200, others = 100)
   - Combat boosts (15 base + 0-4 boost for attacks)
   - Quantum operations (quantum move = 100, teleport = 25)

4. **Territory Control**: Consider multiple strategies:
   - Energy accumulation (harvesters on nodes)
   - Map control (spread units for territory percentage)
   - Combat dominance (eliminate enemy units)

5. **Quantum Mechanics**: Learn to leverage:
   - Entanglement zones for warrior enhancement
   - Decoherence fields for defense
   - Quantum gates for mobility and healing
   - Barriers for area denial

6. **Exploration Priority**: Early scouting provides permanent vision advantage
   - Use scouts (3-tile vision range) for efficient exploration
   - Track enemy movements in explored areas
   - Monitor resource depletion in real-time

### Example Agent Logic

```python
def get_action(self, observation):
    actions = {}
    player_units = self._get_player_units(observation)
    
    for unit_id, player_id, unit_type, x, y, health, energy, is_boosted, boost_attacks in player_units:
        pos = (x, y)
        
        if unit_type == UnitType.HARVESTER.value:
            # Move toward nearest energy node
            action = self._harvester_strategy(pos, observation)
            
        elif unit_type == UnitType.WARRIOR.value:
            # Attack nearby enemies or move toward enemy territory
            action = self._warrior_strategy(pos, health, is_boosted, observation)
            
        elif unit_type == UnitType.SCOUT.value:
            # Explore, spawn units, or build structures
            action = self._scout_strategy(pos, observation)
        
        actions[unit_id] = action
    
    return actions

def _get_player_units(self, observation):
    """Extract and return player's units from observation."""
    units = observation['units']
    return units[units[:, 1] == self.player_id]

def _get_enemy_units(self, observation):
    """Extract and return enemy units from observation."""
    units = observation['units']
    return units[units[:, 1] != self.player_id]
```

## Running Games

### Command Line Interface

Run agent vs agent games using `agent_v_agent_script.py`:

```bash
# Basic usage
python -m quantum_harvest.agent_v_agent_script \
    --agent1 my_agent.py \
    --agent2 opponent_agent.py

# With custom settings
python -m quantum_harvest.agent_v_agent_script \
    --agent1 my_agent.py \
    --agent2 opponent_agent.py \
    --map-size 16 \
    --max-turns 500

# Headless mode (no visualization)
python -m quantum_harvest.agent_v_agent_script \
    --agent1 my_agent.py \
    --agent2 opponent_agent.py \
    --no-visualization

# Fast simulation
python -m quantum_harvest.agent_v_agent_script \
    --agent1 my_agent.py \
    --agent2 opponent_agent.py \
    --no-visualization \
    --turn-delay 0
```

### Command Line Options

- `--agent1`: Path to Python file containing agent for player 1 (required)
- `--agent2`: Path to Python file containing agent for player 2 (required)
- `--map-size`: Size of the game map (default: 12)
- `--max-turns`: Maximum number of turns (default: 1000)
- `--no-visualization`: Disable pygame visualization
- `--no-logging`: Disable game state logging
- `--turn-delay`: Delay between turns in seconds (default: 0.1)

### Agent File Requirements

Your agent file must:
- Contain a class named `Agent`
- Inherit from `BaseAgent`
- Implement `get_action(observation, player_id)` method
- Implement `reset()` method
- Accept `player_id` parameter in constructor

The script automatically detects and instantiates the `Agent` class.

### Example Agent File Structure

```python
# my_agent.py
import numpy as np
from quantum_harvest.agents import BaseAgent
from quantum_harvest.utils import UnitType, ActionType, TileType

class Agent(BaseAgent):
    def __init__(self, player_id: int):
        super().__init__(player_id)
        # Your initialization here
    
    def get_action(self, observation, player_id=0):
        actions = {}
        # Your strategy here
        return actions
    
    def reset(self):
        super().reset()
        # Reset your agent state here
```

## Replay Visualization

### HTML Replay Visualizer

The game includes a powerful HTML-based replay visualizer that runs in your web browser.

### Launching the Visualizer

```bash
# Open visualizer without loading a replay
python -m quantum_harvest.run_replay_visualizer

# Open visualizer with a specific replay file
python -m quantum_harvest.run_replay_visualizer game_log_20241201_143022.json
